# OOP Project in C++

This project was made for my object-oriented programming class for college.

## About 
This project is a console application made for a real estate company. The scope of this application is helping with the management of clients, real estate, agents and contracts.  

## Functionalities

The main functionalities of this application are: <br />
• Reading and writing to text files, binary files and CSV files <br />
• Reading and writing from console <br />
• Saving all the contracts in the contracts archive, which can be viewed in the console or saved in a file<br />
• Data mining to see all the user's interactions with the application<br />


## Design 

When the user starts the application, objects are uploaded from files passed as arguments. If there are no text files passed as arguments, the objects are loaded from binary files from the local system.<br />
After the objects are loaded into vectors, the application starts and the main menu loads, where the user can choose through numeric input what action wishes to take

When the user chooses what action to take, he is redirected to a secondary menu where he can choose what information to save or extract.

The user can also view or save the contracts archive
